Q 1 ANS - A unit is a standard quantity used to measure a physical quantity. It provides a common reference point for comparison and communication of measurements.   

Properties of a Unit:

Universality: A unit should be universally accepted and recognized to ensure consistency in measurements across different locations and time periods.   
Precision: A unit should be defined with sufficient precision to allow for accurate measurements.   
Convenience: A unit should be of a convenient size for practical applications. It should not be too large or too small.
Reproducibility: A unit should be reproducible, meaning it can be recreated or replicated with the same level of accuracy.
Consistency: A unit should be consistent with other units in a system of measurement. For example, units of length, mass, and time should be related in a consistent way.



2) Uses of Dimensional Analysis

Error Checking: It helps verify the dimensional consistency of physical equations, ensuring correctness.
Unit Conversion: Assists in converting units across different measurement systems (e.g., meters to feet).
Deriving Relationships: Dimensional analysis can establish relationships among physical quantities even without complete formulas.
Simplification: By identifying fundamental units, it reduces the complexity of physical problems.
Predictive Power: It can predict the form of relationships in new, unexplored physical phenomena.
3) Example on Significant Figures & Error

Significant Figures: These are digits that carry meaning and precision in a measurement. For example, in 0.00450 kg, the significant figures are 4, 5, and 0, totaling three significant figures.
Types of Error:
Absolute Error: The difference between the measured and actual value. E.g., if the measured length is 5.26 cm and the actual is 5.20 cm, the absolute error is 0.06 cm.
Relative Error: The absolute error divided by the actual value.
Percentage Error: Relative error multiplied by 100 to express in percentage form.
4) Prove the Parallelogram Law of Vector Addition

Statement: The law states that if two vectors are represented as adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal represents their resultant.
Proof: Let vectors A and B be positioned with a common point. The parallelogram is completed by drawing vectors equal to A and B from the other ends. The diagonal R represents the sum.
Mathematics:
𝑅
=
𝐴
+
𝐵
R=A+B
Use trigonometry for exact values.
Conclusion: The resultant vector lies along the diagonal, proving the parallelogram law.
5) Numerical on Vector Product

Example Problem: Calculate the cross product of vectors A = 3i + 4j and B = 2i + 5j.
Solution: Use the determinant form to find 
𝐴
⃗

6) Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

Law of Orbits: Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the Sun at one focus.
Law of Areas: A line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
Law of Periods: The square of a planet’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit, 
𝑇

Importance: These laws describe planetary motion, predict orbital behavior, and form the basis for understanding celestial mechanics.
7) Define Binding Energy, Escape Velocity, and Critical Velocity

Binding Energy: The minimum energy required to remove an object from a gravitational field (e.g., Earth’s surface).
Escape Velocity: Minimum speed for an object to escape a planet’s gravity. For Earth, it’s about 11.2 km/s.
Critical Velocity: Speed at which a satellite must travel to maintain a stable orbit, balancing gravitational pull and centrifugal force.
8) Geostationary Satellite and its Applications

Definition: A satellite that orbits Earth at the equator with an orbital period equal to Earth's rotation (24 hours). It appears stationary relative to a fixed point.
Altitude: Approximately 35,786 km.
Applications: Used in telecommunications, broadcasting, GPS, and weather forecasting. It ensures continuous monitoring of a specific area.
9) Newton's Law of Gravitation in Vector Form
